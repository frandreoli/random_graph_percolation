# 1 - Introduction

The code stuies the super-cluster phase transition in a random graph with all-to-all connections. The main calculation is provided by a C script, which exploits a tree-search algorithm to retrieve and store information about the individual clusters. A Python (Jupyter) notebook is provided which can either execute the C script or retrieve and analyzed previously stored data.
